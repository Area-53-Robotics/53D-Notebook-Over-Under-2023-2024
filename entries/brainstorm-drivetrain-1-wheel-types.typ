        - *Omnidirectional Movement* - enabling the robot to move forward, backward, and sideways with ease
        - *Strafing* - The ability to strafe easily allow the robot to navigate around obstacles, align with targets, or avoid opponents
        - *Versatility* - Omni wheels are versatile and can be incorporated into various drive train configuration
      ],
      [
        - *Reduced Traction* - Omni wheels  have less traction compared to other wheel types, which would make us easy to push around by other teams
        - *Limited Load-Bearing Capacity* - Omni wheels have a lower load-bearing capacity compared to some other wheel types
        - *Less stability at high speed* - Omni wheels can lead to less stability at high speeds or during rapid acceleration and deceleration. This instability may affect the robot's ability to maintain control.

        - *High Traction* - Traction wheels are designed to maximize grip on the surface
        - *Stability* - Traction wheels contribute to the stability of the robot, especially at higher speeds or during rapid acceleration and deceleration. 
        - *Pushing Power* - well-suited for applications that require the robot to exert pushing or pulling forces
      ],
      [
        - *Limited Maneuverability* - Traction wheels are typically designed for straightforward movement
        - *Wheel Scrubbing* - Traction wheels in a tank drive configuration may experience wheel scrubbing during turns, causing excessive wears

      [
        - *Complex Programming* - Programming a mecanum drive system can be more complex compared to traditional drive systems

      [
        - *Basic Maneuverability* - Excels in basic maneuverability (forward, backward, and turns)
        - *Pivoting* - Wheels can pivot easily, putting less stress on the motors
        - *Availability* - Area 53 has multiple omnis of different sizes in storage
      ],
      [
        - *Low Traction* - Makes it easier to be pushed around by other teams, which could inhibit our ability to score and match load
        - *Strafing* - Omni wheels cannot strafe diagonally, and a tank drive with omnis cannot strafe side-to-side on command
      ],

        #image("/assets/drivetrain/TankDriveTraction.excalidraw.svg", height: 12em)],
      [
        - *Immovability* - Cannot be pushed from the side by other teams, making it easier to match load
        - *Force* - Generates a lot of traction, which makes it easier to push other teams
      ],
      [
        - *Maneuverability* - Cannot strafe side-to-side or diagonally, severely limiting our movement
        - *Inefficient Turns* - Makes it harder for the driver to make quick responses on the field
        - *Slow* - Has the slowest speed out of all the wheel types
        - *Motor Strain* - The low maneuverability of traction wheels puts strain on motors
        - *Availability* - Area 53 does not currently have many 3.25‚Äù traction wheels in storage, so if we want to use that size we will have to delay construction
        - *Wheel Durability* - A full traction drive displays wear and tear on the wheel quicker than any other drivetrain.

      [
        - *Motor Strain* - Has a decreased strain on motors compared to full traction wheels
        - *Immovability* - More protected against pushing compared to a full omni configuration
        - *Versatility* - The combination allows for smooth transitions between omnidirectional movement and enhanced traction.

        - Relatively simple to build
        - Difficult to move from the side
        - Able to strafe
        - Can get into more precise positions than a full omni drive
      ],
      [
        - *Driving* - Driving can be clunky, especially because nobody on 53D has driven a mecanum configuration before
        - *Building Precision* - Wheels have to be orientated in a certain matter to allow strafing
        - *Less Traction* - Due to the mecanum rollers, mecanum wheels have less surface area than omnis and traction wheels, causing them to have less traction.
        - Weigh more than omnis
        - Requires more complex programming
        - Requires more torque from the motors
