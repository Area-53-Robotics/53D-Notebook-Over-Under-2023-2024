    - Gathered C-channel
      - A pair of 6 holes C-channel
      - 7 holes C-channel
      - 8 holes C-channel serving as the holder for the catapult
    - Created and slipped gears. Attached with a screw joint 
      - We attached two slip [Teeth] gears to help with consistency
      - The gear ratio is [TBD]
    - Gathered 0.5‚Äù stand-offs to box the catapult
    - Gathered several long stand-offs and collars and created the catapult arm

    - Replaced inner stand-offs with spacers for better boxing
    - Attached crossbar on the front of the bot
      - Connect a 5 long 5 C-channel onto the crossbar
      - Attach the catapult onto it
    - Created a stopper for the catapult
    - Problem: Lack of tension on the front of catapult
    - Solution: Double twisting the rubber bands allowed for more secure contact

    - Added the motor cartridges to the intake
    - Attached triangle braces to help brace the catapult 
    - Problem: Similar to the problem last meeting, a lack of tension on the rubberband connecting to the catapult arm.
    - Solution: Add a stand-off perpendicular to the arm. This will serve as our new stopper and add rubber bands.
