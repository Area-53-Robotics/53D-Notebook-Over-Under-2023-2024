53D had a great season during Spin Up, managing to make it to the States championship and qualifying for the elimination matches as the 17th ranked team out of 90. The team has gained a wealth of knowledge about building strategies and how to assess build quality, which will be invaluable for the upcoming season.

As the programmer of the squad, I am proud of our program improvements over the season. We implemented various features, such as a Pre-Auton driver menu, joystick curving, an absolute position tracking system, and a PID movement & turning system for the autonomous phase. Next year, I plan to implement pure pursuit into our autonomous routes to create smooth and consistent turns. This would greatly expand our movement options in autonomous, allowing us to create more efficient routes than our competitors and stand out better to judges.

I predict that the next challenge will be a stacking game of some kind. VEX has established a cycle of having a shooting game (Turning Point, 2018-19), followed by a stacking game (Tower Takeover, 2019-20 & Change Up, 2020-21), and ending with a possession game (Tipping Point, 2021-22). VRC followed this cycle for Spin Up (2022-23), and I believe it will also hold up for the next season.

Spin Up was my first year participating in robotics, and I am proud to say that I have learned many new things this season, and my knowledge has expanded. Experiencing hands-on building, learning how to build different subsystems, and finally, learning what it takes to be a good notebooker. As the lead notebooker, I am excited to pass on my knowledge of notebooking to the new generation of Freshmen next season. I am truly in awe of the knowledge and memories I have made this year. I hope next season will be just as amazing!

My predictions for next season are that the next game will include elements of stacking and platforms. I predict this because, from my observations, I can see a pattern within the VEX games that each season tends to alternate aspects of stacking and shooting.

The VEX Spin Up season was my first year leading the construction of the robot as the lead builder. When the season started, I treated it how I did last year by just designing one or two pieces of the robot, but I soon realized that as the lead builder, my responsibility was not just to build but also to teach the people on my team as the most important part of robotics is not to win, but to pass on the knowledge that you have to others. Next year, I plan to CAD and design everything before starting construction and to have the freshman on the team build it using the CAD almost as instructions, so they can learn strategies of building through trial and error while I can oversee the construction and guide them in the correct direction. Eventually, I hope that they can become teachers and pass on the abilities that I passed on to them.

On a different note, I predict that next year's game will revolve more around stacking and platforms as it has been a pattern in VEX to have a game that mostly revolves around shooting and then the next year it will be mostly oriented around stacking.
