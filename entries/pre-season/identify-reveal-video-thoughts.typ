= Game Object
The triballs have a weird shape, which might make them harder to intake and hold than previous game objects like the Spin Up disks and the Tipping Point rings.

= Scoring Method
The scoring method feels less engaging and more straightforward than Spin Up.

= Double-Zoning
We think that this is the most interesting part of the new season's game. With the punishment for double-zoning being your alliance's triballs becoming vulnerable, it encourages more teamwork between members of an alliance than in Spin Up. To achieve the best outcome, alliance partners must pass triballs between each other while on different sides of the field. This game element also encourages teams to be perceptive to quickly recognize when their opponents' triballs are vulnerable so that they can de-score them.

= End-Game Elevation
This method of endgame scoring is much more complicated than in Spin Up and Tipping Point. We predict that a robot's ability to climb up the elevation pole will separate the average teams from the great teams this season.

= Bot-Building
We predict that robots made this year will be made to be as light as possible. Because robots can only hold one triball at a time, a robot only really needs a claw mechanism to succeed in the main phase of the game. We predict that PTO systems to transfer power between mechanisms will be useful this season so that at the endgame, bots will have enough power to climb up the elevation pole.

= Overall
We think this season will have a big gap between the average and top teams. Most teams will be able to pick up triballs and score, but the best teams will take advantage of double-zoning restrictions and the endgame elevation poles to score the most points possible.
