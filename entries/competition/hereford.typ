= Subsystem Reflection
== Drivetrain
=== Red
- Gave us the most trouble this tournament. Zipties got caught in the drivetrain in the first match. Gear slippage made one side of the drivetrain nearly unusable in the second match. After that it was workable, but what Makhi did is a temporary fix.
- Our plan to fix these problems is a complete rebuild of the drivetrain after our Dec. 16 Tournament.

== Intake
=== Green
- Worked consistently, we even managed to intake into the cata a few times.
- In the future, we might want to make the catapult longer to grab triballs easier, and maybe even reach the inside of the match load zone for AWP.

== Catapult
=== Yellow 
- Worked consistently, but the cycling was a bit slow compared to other teams. Maybe if we increase the banding, and add PID to the catapult, we might be able to get the cycle time a bit faster.
- Also important to note that Makhi used the manual catapult, control instead of the automatic catapult control most of the tournament 
- Only got the auto catapult code working post our last qual, so getting the auto catapult code consistent might also make it faster.
- Auto catapult control wasn't working at the beginning of the tournament (even though it worked the night before), so we had to use manual control during the tournament.
== Wings
=== Green
- They worked every round . We managed to push quite a few triballs at a time with them.
- We are planning to add guards to each wing to make them more sturdy.


= Individual Reflections
== Ajibola
- I learned about better notebooking techniques, specifically that reflecting on each individual subsystem is more important than reflection on each individual match. Also explaining the methods behind the testing phase in the design process.
- We need to spend more time before tournaments practicing match loading and auton. Better time management might help with this.

== Ishika 
- The de-scoring thing cannot be our main point because in bigger matches it will be harder to do this with more resourceful teams. A lot of our functions stopped working after being hit so we need to work on keeping them safe. 
- Everything surrounds the functions of the robot and keeping the robot safe.
- We should work on making sure everything is set to work before the next tournament. We do not want to be fixing major problems at the next tournament.

== Makhi 
- Our driving was great with the use of descoring however our subsystems need work and testing
- We ran into a problem with our catapult. It was really slow compared to other teams and also very inconsistent. We should definitely do more testing before the next tournament 

== Rory
- Bots got stuck in the banding of our bot twice and the wings broke twice. A motor also fell out from the catapult, but the main problem was the drivetrain not working correctly

== Eric
- While our driving exhibited excellence, particularly in effective descoring maneuvers, our subsystems revealed areas that require improvement and thorough testing. The catapult, in particular, posed a challenge as it operated at a slower pace compared to other teams and exhibited inconsistency. It's evident that additional testing is imperative before the next tournament to address these issues and ensure optimal performance.
- I suggest we should rebuild the drive-train that isnâ€™t focus on descoring
