= Scrimmage Reflection
== Drivetrain
Our drivetrain performed admirably throughout the scrimmage, showcasing its agility and maneuverability on the field. The robot navigated swiftly, allowing us to strategically position ourselves.

== Low Catapult
Our Catapult struggled to shoot over to the other side. This is bad because we can't fire triballs to the other side for our alliance partner. We noticed that it didn't have enough torque to sent the triballs to where we want them to be.

== Wings
Didn't work as intended. They aren't as responsive as we liked them to be and struggled to extend.

== Rubberband Intake
It successfully executed the ejection or placement of triballs as intended. This reliability in the outtake process played a crucial role in our team's ability to execute strategic moves and contribute points to the overall score.
