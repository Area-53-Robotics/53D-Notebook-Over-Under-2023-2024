    The quickest way to get from one side of the field to the other is by crossing over the middle barrier. We will need some type of sleds on our robot in order to achieve that goal.

    Sleds work best on low-friction surfaces or structures that allow a robot to slide or move smoothly across. Specifically for this challenge, the sleds need to help the robot glide over the middle barrier.

    - Due to the flexibility of polycarbonate, any side impact on the sleds will cause them to crack or break
