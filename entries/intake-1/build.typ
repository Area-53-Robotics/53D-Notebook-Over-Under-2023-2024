        Today we planned on constructing the flex wheel axle. Additionally, attention was directed towards the construction of the support structure, an essential element that provides stability.

        == Build Steps
        - Attached two 3‚Äù stand-oofs on the inner side of the chassis. 
          - Attached spacers and collars to level it higher
        - Added plates that serve as the intake base
        - Added the bearing
          - Attached the axle and sprockets
        - #text(red)[Problem:] The rubber bands did not have enough tension to stay taut
        - #text(green)[Solution:] Add flex wheels on the inside, providing more grip onto the triballs

        With the intake near completion, we began adding final supports while preparing to test the intake. With the Dulaney tournament upcoming, we had to build quickly today.

        == Build Steps
        - Replace the sprockets to a bigger one
          - *Reason:* We noticed that the sprockets on the inside were really small. This made the rubberbands really compact to each other. 
        - Added spacers on the inside for boxing 
        - Attached pillow bearings on the middle of the bot 
          - Attached the intake to the middle pillow bearings

        - #text(red)[Problem:] Lack of tension on the front of catapult
        - #text(green)[Solution:] Double twisting the rubber bands allowed for more secure contact
