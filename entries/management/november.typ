We were almost perfectly on schedule, with the only exception being that we spent longer building the catapult when planned. However, this did not slow down any of our other tasks, so our time management last month was successful.

= November Gantt Chart
With the Area 53 Scrimmage upcoming on on 2023/10/21, we need to finish the creation of the catapult and wings ASAP. We plan to speed up the engineering design process for these subsystems to ensure we are ready for the scrimmage.
