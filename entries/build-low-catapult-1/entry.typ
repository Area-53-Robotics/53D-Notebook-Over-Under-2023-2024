        - Gathered c-channel
          - A pair of 6 holes C-channel
          - 7 holes C-channel
          - 8 holes C-channel serving as the holder for the catapult
        - Created and slipped gears. Attached with a screw joint 
          - We attached two slip [Teeth] gears to help with consistency
          - The gear ratio is [TBD]
        - Gathered 0.5‚Äù stand-offs to box the catapult
        - Gathered several long stand-offs and collars and created the catapult arm

        - Replaced inner stand-offs with spacers for better boxing
        - Attached crossbar on the front of the bot
          - Connect a 5 long 5 C-channel onto the crossbar
          - Attach the catapult onto it
        - Created a stopper for the catapult
        - Problem: Lack of tension on the front of catapult
        - Solution: Double twisting the rubber bands allowed for more secure contact

        - Added the motor cartridges to the intake
        - Attached triangle braces to help brace the catapult 
        - Problem: Similar to the problem last meeting, a lack of tension on the rubberband connecting to the catapult arm.
        - Solution: Add a stand-off perpendicular to the arm. This will serve as our new stopper and add rubber bands.
